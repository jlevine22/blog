I have been using an iPad 2 since the day it came out. I've loved using it since the day I got it and it's held up very well over the past 5 years, an eternity in technology time. It was simply time to upgrade. I'm the kind of person who likes to go big because otherwise why bother? I think that sentiment really fits with getting an iPad Pro. This thing fits that description in many ways: big screen, big performance, and a price tag to match.

## What's Good

### Performance

The key word here is FAST. Apps load fast. App switching is fast. Everything is FAST.

### Size

Despite it's size, it feels smaller in the hand than you'd expect. It has almost the same weight as a 4th generation iPad. The additional screen real estate really makes multitasking shine.

Using the iPad as a 2nd screen for your laptop is nothing new. Heck you could even use an iPhone as an additional screen. It's never been that helpful though as you've been limited by the screen size. The iPad Pro at 12.9" is like having a portable 2nd monitor. It essentially doubles the screen real estate of my 13" Macbook Pro. Using Duet (which requires the USB cable) makes the experience even better.

### Smart Keyboard Case

Typing on smart keyboard case feels fairly natural. It didn't take very long to get used to at all. It's sturdy enough to even use on your lap in some cases. The keyboard also has 2 different modes (keyboard and viewing) which are both pretty sturdy.

### Pencil

The pencil feels good in the hand and is very accurate for drawing. I mostly use it for diagramming things and it works well for that. I'm not much of an artist but it's also worked really well for drawing.

### Sound

The 4 speakers really shine in the iPad Pro. The sound is loud and clear.

## What's Bad

### Software
With all the new screen real estate and keyboard there is an opportunity to really make the iPad Pro a great replacement for a laptop. I think many people could use it for this purpose right now.  For a lot of people (myself included) I think the iPad Pro falls short on that front. With more time and software improvements I think this will change.

### Price

It is a bit more expansive that I would have preferred, especially once you throw in the smart keyboard and the pencil.

### Size

While this is one of the things I like about the iPad Pro it also has it's disadvantages. It makes using it as a handheld device a bit more difficult.

## Conclusion

Potential. That iPad Pro has lots of potential. The hardware today is simply incredible. The software has it's rough spots. It's great today, but as the software improves the iPad Pro will get better with time.
