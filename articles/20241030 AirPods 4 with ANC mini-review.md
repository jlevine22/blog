## AirPods 4 w/ANC mini-review

<!-- preview -->
I’ve been using Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation since they were released, but only just had the chance this past weekend to take them on a flight. Here’s a few thoughts:

#### The Case: 
Since the case is smaller, the AirPods sit closer together. This makes it a little bit more difficult to pick up that first AirPod when removing them from the case.

#### Fit: 
Regular AirPods have always fit comfortably in my ears. Although AirPods 4 are slightly smaller than their predecessors, they still provide a good fit. For me, AirPods 3 fit a big more snugly, but AirPods 4 are still a comfortable option.

#### ANC: 
I’d rate the noise cancellation a solid 7 out of 10. High-end over-the-ear headphones like the Bose QC700 or AirPods Max would be a 10. On my recent flight, the active noise cancellation in AirPods 4 really helped block out the airplane noise, making it much easier to enjoy my podcasts and music.

#### ANC continued:
While it works well, it can take a few seconds to kick in. If you bump or adjust your AirPods, the noise cancellation stops for a moment. In some cases, it never re-engages until you adjust your AirPods’ positioning.

#### Overall:
A great addition to the AirPods lineup! While I have AirPods Pro 2, I never liked the fit and prefer regular AirPods. If you find yourself in a similar boat, AirPods 4 w/ANC are for you.
