## Race Report: Emerald Bay Trail Run

<!-- preview -->
I have been running now for about a year and a half. The majority of that has been on the road. I've decided this summer to throw some trail running into the mix. It's nice to save a little bit of pounding on the knees and to mix up the scenery a bit. Being Tahoe, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Trails. For my first trail race I chose the [Emerald Bay Trail Run](http://www.tahoetrailrunning.com/trail-runs/emerald-bay-trail-run/). It's advertised as a 7.5 mile fast trail run with low/moderate climbing.

I woke up about 6:30 and the first thing I did was check the air outside. It's been incredibly smokey here all week because of the [King Fire](http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/4108/). Fortunately, the wind direction shifted throughout the day Friday, blowing the smoke away from the Tahoe basin. The air was clear and fresh for the first time all week! I got to the Eagle Point Campgrounds at Emerald Bay around 7:45am. The weather was a little mild for this time of year with the morning temperatures being in the low 50's/upper 40's. I had planned to start the race with arm warmers but didn't even need them while waiting around for the race to start at 9.

The race started exactly at 9am. The course starts out with a 1/2 mile run up a paved road through the campground before switching onto the trail. Almost immediately after getting into the trail I was stuck in a line of people running down a single track trail. After a few minutes the trail opened up a little bit to allow for passing. The trail then flattens out for a about 3 spectacular miles along the shoreline of Emerald Bay. There were 3 aid stations along the course at 0.5 miles, 2 miles, and about 3 miles. The placement seems a bit odd but I think it was just parts of the trail that were accessible by vehicle for getting water in. Around 4.5 miles in the trail kicks uphill for a little over a mile for a climb that was a bit harder than I thought it would be from looking at the course profile. The climb featured a few sets of steep rock stair cases before turning into a more gradual dirt path. Parts of the climb are very narrow along steep hills that run right down to Lake Tahoe. Over a mile of climbing later and the final descent down to Lester Beach began. The trail turning downwards was a welcome feeling for my burning legs. About 1/4 mile before getting to the beach there was an interesting section of trail. It's a narrow section with a chain rope on your right and overhanging rock  on your left. It requires ducking or leaning awkwardly in order to pass without knocking your head. I made it through that section unscathed and then a few minutes later crossed the finish line at Lester Beach. My finishing time was 1:20:16, good for a ~11:30min/mile pace (6.9 miles on the watch). It's a bit slower than I thought I'd be but the course was also a bit harder than I thought as well. There was just under 1000 feet of climbing according to my Garmin watch.

Overall it was a very satisfying experience. The weather was perfect, the course was spectacular, and I met some really nice people. The only thing I didn't like was that it seemed crowded on the course and a few times I was stuck in running lines waiting for the trail to open up and allow passing. I don't know if this is typical to trail races or if it was just this particular race.
