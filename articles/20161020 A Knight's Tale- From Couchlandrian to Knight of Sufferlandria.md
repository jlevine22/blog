I have a confession to make. I am a recovering Couchlandrian. On November 19th, 2016 I became a [Knight of Sufferlandria](https://thesufferfest.com/pages/knights-of-sufferlandria). In order to achieve knighthood, one must complete 10 Sufferfest videos back to back. If you've ever done one Sufferfest video you will understand how daunting a task this is. To the outside observer, it looks like I spend 8 hours and 34 minutes on my quest for knighthood. In reality it really took 3 years, 6 months, 8 hours, and 34 minutes. Read on for my story.

### Back Story

For some who've known me a long time, the idea that I'd spend nearly 10 straight hours a bike seems out of character. In my 20s I'm not sure if I completed 10 hours TOTAL of excercise. I was somewhat active growing up and relatively fit as I played soccer in high school. After graduation, things changed and I became much less active. Over the next decade my physical activity was limited to snowboarding in the winter, the occassional hike, and being dragged to the gym by my father a couple times a year.

In December of 2008 I moved across the country from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Truckee, California. For those unaware, Truckee is a playground for the outdoor enthusiast offering something for everyone. There are world class attractions in every direction; alpine skiing/snowboarding, cross country skiing, road biking, mountain biking, hiking, trail running, rock climbing, kayaking, white water rafting, stand up paddle boarding, and so much more. Despite the ample opportunities, it took me a while to fully embrace them.

In 2013, about 6 months before my 30th birthday, everything changed. It's hard to say exactly why, but I started to view myself differently. I was tipping the scales at 199 pounds, just shy of 200, a number I swore I'd never let myself cross. I was fed up and knew that I could not continue in my 30s with the same lifestyle I had lived in my 20s.

### Knighthood

If I said I felt prepared for my knighthood I would be lying. Ask a Sufferlandrian how to prepare for knighthood and the answer you'll hear most often is "You can't". If I were to prepare, something along these lines might be appropriate:

On the morning of my knighthood, I arrived at Orange Pedal Cycling around 6:40am. I had planned to start riding at 7am in order to finish around 5pm. I had already setup the trainer and my bike the night before so the only real setup involved positioning my laptop running The Sufferfest Training Centre and setting up my nutrition table. At exactly 7am I was ready to roll and my knighthood quest began.

Through 3 videos, everything was going well. I was feeling good, steadily taking in fluids and nutrition. In between each video I would hop off the bike and do a little stretching as well as give my ass a break from the saddle. As good as I felt early on, I knew it wouldn't last. I was bracing for the storm. About halfway through The Best Thing In The World (#4), things took a turn. I could slowly feel my body turning against me. Every stroke of the pedal felt a little worse than the last. I push forward.

With 4 videos done, and 3 and a half hours of riding under my belt, the relative euphoria of the first 3 videos was long gone. A storm was rolling in and the best I could do was batten down the hatches and hang on for dear life. I pressed onwards with video 5, Angels. By this point, everything was hurting and I was starting to question why I was doing this. My nutrition intake began to slow. Luckily, Stefano of Orange Pedal was there constantly reminding me to keep drinking. After finishing Angels, I thought I was in real trouble given how bad I was already feeling just half way through. It would take a special kind of effort to finish. I push forward.

Revolver was up next to kick off the 2nd half. I am suffering immensely now and it seems like time is slowing down. The next few videos are a full on category 5 huricane of pain and misery. I wanted to quit so bad but I pushed through. I would focus on each video's short little intervals and just making it to the next, one minute at a time. 8 videos down, 2 more to go. I am starting to believe again that I will be able to finish. It feels like there is a tail wind at my back. Unfortunately I am riding uphill into an even stronger headwind of pain and agony. 

As I start A Very Dark Place (#9 and appropriately named for the moment), I have never physically felt so bad. I am hurting from head to toe. Much of my riding at this point is being done in a hunched over position:

I am soley focused on turning over the pedals at this point. I am incapable of any kind of rational thinking. My body is begging for mercy. I am ignoring it. 9 down, 1 to go. The only thing standing between me and everlasting glory is Thin Air and it's 40 minute sustained climb up Mt. Sufferlandria. I crawl back on the back after my 10 minute break and start to pedal again. The first few pedal strokes are excruciating.
