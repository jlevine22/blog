About a month ago I was at my Silicon Mountain Group meeting, a meetup of tech professionals living in and around the Lake Tahoe area. There was a new sponsor for that meeting, Accela, and they were promoting Accela Connect, a developer/partner conference for their civic data platform. At the time I wasn't terribly interested in civic data but what caught my eye was that the conference was kicking off a hackathon (with cash prizes!).
