## A year with Apple Vision Pro

<!-- preview -->
It's been more than a year since I picking up Apple Vision Pro, and with rumors starting to fly about the next generation of the device, it seems like a good time to record my thoughts on the first version of the device. At launch I was a bit mixed on whether to fork over $3500 for this crazy new device. After reading some of the intial reviews and experiencing the demo myself in store, I succumbed to the FOMO 2 weeks after launch and purchased my own.

So after more than a year, is it worth the insane asking price? Simply put: ofcourse not. The true answer is a bit more complicated and nuanced.
