## 2016 ADDY Awards

<!-- preview -->
The 2016 ADDY Awards were held last night at the Perppermill Casino.  The ADDYs are the AAF Reno's (American Advertising Federation) yearly awards for local companies in the marketing and advertising industry. White Rabbit received 7 golds, 1 silver, and 2 best in show. One of the gold ADDY awards was for The Sufferfest, a mobile app I have been working on for the past 6 months or so. It was a great night overall and a lot of fun!
