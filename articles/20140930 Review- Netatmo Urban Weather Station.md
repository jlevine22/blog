I've had my eye on the Netatmo Urban Weather Station for quite a while. In addition to being a data junkie I'm also very interested in weather as well (I even wrote a weather iPhone app!). With the King Fire pumping smoke into the Tahoe basin, I'd really like a way to know when conditions are safe for outdoor activity. After playing with it for a little bit, I found it didn't quite work the way I thought.

#### Unboxing & Setup
There's not a whole lot in the box. There's the indoor and outdoor modules, a USB power plug, 2 AAA batteries, and a screw for mounting the outdoor module. Setting up the station was fairly straight foreward. You plug in the indoors module and put the batteries into the outdoor module. The mobile app will guide you through the setup process. It uses bluetooth to initially connect to the indoors module and setup the wifi connection. In order to record and access all of the sensor readings later, you must create a Netatmo account.

#### Outdoor Module

The outdoor module is wireless and runs on 2 x AAA batteries. It measures temperature and humidity. It's a little bit disappointing that it doesn't measure more than that. Setting up the outdoor module is as simple as installing the batteries and placing the module outdoors. The module should be placed where it is not in direct sunlight and where it will not get rained on. The first place I put mine was underneath an overhang leading up to the front door of my house. After a few minutes of monitoring the temperature it was clear this was not a good spot. The reason for this is because the overhang where I placed it was trapping heat (like an attic almost) and the temperature readings were way too hot. I ended up placing mine underneath a deck on the back of the house. You may have to play around with the placement to get accurate temperature readings.

#### Indoor Module
The indoor module looks the same as the outdoor module but is bigger. Unlike the outdoor module, it must be plugged in to an outlet or a USB port. It is capable of measuring temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, CO2 concentration, and ambient noise levels.


#### Viewing Data
All of the sensor data can be accessed from the free mobile app provided by Netatmo or from the Netatmo website. In addition to all of the sensor readings, the app and website will show you a weather forecast in addition to the air quality index (outdoors) and a "room comfort index" (indoors). At first I thought air quality index was coming from sensors on the outdoor module. Yesterday afternoon we had smoke from the King Fire roll into the Truckee basin pretty thick. I watched as the air quality index values seemed to be dropping (instead of getting worse). After a little digging it turns out that those numbers come from the national weather service (and not even from local sites). My air quality index value was coming from the NWS in Reno (about 30 miles away). Disappointing to say the least.

The mobile app seems to work fairly well. I really don't have any complaints with the app itself. The only thing I would say is that the styling of the app seems a bit circa iOS5 and is probably in need of some updating. Everything works though and that's the important part.

#### Summary
Even before getting the Netatmo Urban Weather Station, I've always used indoor/outdoor thermometers around the house. I'm always interested in the current conditions. The Netatmo Urban Weather Station takes this interest to another level, allowing more data to be collected, recorded, and viewed remotely. Setup is easy and so far the data seems accurate. It's a little disappointing that the outdoor module does not measure air quality. Overall I like the Netatmo Urban Weather Station but feel like it should do a little bit more to justify it's $180 price tag.
