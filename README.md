## [My Blog in 2025- From Node Servers to Pure GitHub Markdown](articles/20250418%20My%20Blog%20in%202025-%20From%20Node%20Servers%20to%20Pure%20GitHub%20Markdown.md)
###### April 18th, 2025

Ten years ago I started a blog. As a developer, I *had* to roll my own—Node.js on the backend, Angular on the frontend, and every post sat in a Markdown file with a YAML header that my server parsed. Dropbox handled the sync—simple, cheap, and it just worked.

## [A Knight's Tale- From Couchlandrian to Knight of Sufferlandria](articles/20161020%20A%20Knight's%20Tale-%20From%20Couchlandrian%20to%20Knight%20of%20Sufferlandria.md)
###### October 20th, 2016

I have a confession to make. I am a recovering Couchlandrian. On November 19th, 2016 I became a [Knight of Sufferlandria](https://thesufferfest.com/pages/knights-of-sufferlandria). In order to achieve knighthood, one must complete 10 Sufferfest videos back to back. If you've ever done one Sufferfest video you will understand how daunting a task this is.

The 2016 ADDY Awards were held last night at the Perppermill Casino.  The ADDYs are the AAF Reno's (American Advertising Federation) yearly awards for local companies in the marketing and advertising industry. White Rabbit received 7 golds, 1 silver, and 2 best in show. One of the gold ADDY awards was for The Sufferfest, a mobile app I have been working on for the past 6 months or so.
