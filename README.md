## [My Blog in 2025- From Node Servers to Pure GitHub Markdown](articles/20250418%20My%20Blog%20in%202025-%20From%20Node%20Servers%20to%20Pure%20GitHub%20Markdown.md)
###### April 18th, 2025

Ten years ago I started a blog. As a developer, I *had* to roll my own—Node.js on the backend, Angular on the frontend, and every post sat in a Markdown file with a YAML header that my server parsed. Dropbox handled the sync—simple, cheap, and it just worked.

It served me for almost a decade, but 2025 called for an even leaner setup.

## [A Knight's Tale- From Couchlandrian to Knight of Sufferlandria](articles/20161020%20A%20Knight's%20Tale-%20From%20Couchlandrian%20to%20Knight%20of%20Sufferlandria.md)
###### October 20th, 2016

I have a confession to make. I am a recovering Couchlandrian. On November 19th, 2016 I became a [Knight of Sufferlandria](https://thesufferfest.com/pages/knights-of-sufferlandria). In order to achieve knighthood, one must complete 10 Sufferfest videos back to back. If you've ever done one Sufferfest video you will understand how daunting a task this is. To the outside observer, it looks like I spend 8 hours and 34 minutes on my quest for knighthood. In reality it really took 3 years, 6 months, 8 hours, and 34 minutes. Read on for my story.

## [MAN Blog 2016](articles/20160327%20MAN%20Blog%202016.md)
###### March 27th, 2016

I built MAN Blog a year ago, mostly as a platform for experimentation. Sure, it would have been easier to install Wordpress and call it a day but where's the fun in that? Over the past few weeks I've been playing with a few new things I've been dying to get my hands on, namely Docker and Koa.js.

The 2016 ADDY Awards were held last night at the Perppermill Casino.  The ADDYs are the AAF Reno's (American Advertising Federation) yearly awards for local companies in the marketing and advertising industry. White Rabbit received 7 golds, 1 silver, and 2 best in show. One of the gold ADDY awards was for The Sufferfest, a mobile app I have been working on for the past 6 months or so. It was a great night overall and a lot of fun!

## [iPad Pro Thoughts](articles/20160306%20iPad%20Pro%20Thoughts.md)
###### March 6th, 2016

I have been using an iPad 2 since the day it came out. I've loved using it since the day I got it and it's held up very well over the past 5 years, an eternity in technology time. It was simply time to upgrade. I'm the kind of person who likes to go big because otherwise why bother? I think that sentiment really fits with getting an iPad Pro. This thing fits that description in many ways: big screen, big performance, and a price tag to match.
