## [A Knight's Tale- From Couchlandrian to Knight of Sufferlandria](articles/20161020%20A%20Knight's%20Tale-%20From%20Couchlandrian%20to%20Knight%20of%20Sufferlandria.md)
###### October 20th, 2016

I have a confession to make. I am a recovering Couchlandrian. On November 19th, 2016 I became a [Knight of Sufferlandria](https://thesufferfest.com/pages/knights-of-sufferlandria). In order to achieve knighthood, one must complete 10 Sufferfest videos back to back. If you've ever done one Sufferfest video you will understand how daunting a task this is. To the outside observer, it looks like I spend 8 hours and 34 minutes on my quest for knighthood. In reality it really took 3 years, 6 months, 8 hours, and 34 minutes. Read on for my story.

I built MAN Blog a year ago, mostly as a platform for experimentation. Sure, it would have been easier to install Wordpress and call it a day but where's the fun in that? Over the past few weeks I've been playing with a few new things I've been dying to get my hands on, namely Docker and Koa.js.

## [2016 ADDY Awards](articles/20160312%202016%20ADDY%20Awards.md)
###### March 12th, 2016

The 2016 ADDY Awards were held last night at the Perppermill Casino.  The ADDYs are the AAF Reno's (American Advertising Federation) yearly awards for local companies in the marketing and advertising industry. White Rabbit received 7 golds, 1 silver, and 2 best in show. One of the gold ADDY awards was for The Sufferfest, a mobile app I have been working on for the past 6 months or so. It was a great night overall and a lot of fun!

## [iPad Pro Thoughts](articles/20160306%20iPad%20Pro%20Thoughts.md)
###### March 6th, 2016

I have been using an iPad 2 since the day it came out. I've loved using it since the day I got it and it's held up very well over the past 5 years, an eternity in technology time. It was simply time to upgrade. I'm the kind of person who likes to go big because otherwise why bother? I think that sentiment really fits with getting an iPad Pro. This thing fits that description in many ways: big screen, big performance, and a price tag to match.

## [Garmin Fenix 3- First Impressions](articles/20150321%20Garmin%20Fenix%203-%20First%20Impressions.md)
###### March 21st, 2015

For the past year or so I've been wearing a Pebble smart watch. I was never really interested in watches as fashion  accessories but more as functional devices. With the rise of cell phones, I never saw the need to carry a second time telling device.  The Pebble brought a new level of convenience  and functionality to the table that a phone didn't. The Pebble's been great for the past year but it was getting a little dated and I think it was just time to move on.

A few days ago I got my hands on a Garmin Fenix 3 Multisport watch. I won't get into the nitty gritty about everything this watch can do. For that, you should read [DC Rainmaker's in depth Fenix 3 review](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2015/03/garmin-fenix3-detailed-review.html). I'll just breifly touch on things I like and don't like.
